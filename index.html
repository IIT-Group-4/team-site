                <h3>Kylie</h3>
                <p>Kylie was born in Hong Kong and moved to Sydney, Australia with her family as a very young child.&nbsp;
		   She grew up with a variety of outdoor interests but when her Dad brought home a Sinclair ZX81 (an early PC prototype made in Cambridge UK) 
	           in 1981 she taught herself to program in Basic.
	           &nbsp;An interest in technology was sparked.&nbsp;
		   As a young adult, Kylie worked her way through several IT roles, progressing from first level Helpdesk, to LAN Admin, to Disaster Recovery for Y2K prep, 
	           to Technical Process Analyst.&nbsp;Her IT interest lies at the intersection of technology and 
		   people and the inherent security challenges, plus what efficiencies IT can offer teams.&nbsp;A move to Queensland in the late 2000s saw a short career pivot  
		   to publishing and marketing.&nbsp;Returning to IT work in 2015, these days Kylie typically project manages teams on 
	           Programs with some sort of transformation such as ERP.&nbsp;She loves bushwalking with her grown up kids.<br>
