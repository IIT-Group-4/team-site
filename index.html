              </header>
              <p>We are a team of three RMIT students who have come together to
                examine some key questions around opportunities and threats in
                today and the future's IT industry. We have completed studies of
                facets of the IT industry over the last few weeks and
                interviewed a knowledgable Cybersecurity expert. Together we are
                developing a Project Idea, to offer to the market an engaging
                and informative Orchid Identification app, Orch.ID. This site
                will introduce you to us and give a brief outline of the
                features and plans for our project idea.</p>

                  quickly and easily identify any species of orchid from a photo
                  they take in real time, upload from their device or features
                  they input. Orch.ID will scan the user’s photo and compare it
                  with an expansive orchid database to deliver the closest
                  possible match. The app will take into account key forms of
                  the orchid, if it is monopodial or sympodial and the colours
                  of the petals; the app will return a shortlist of likely
                  species with corresponding photographs and species’ details. </p>

                <p>For assignment 3, we used Balamiq to work together to develop a low fidelity woreframe prototype. 
                  This facilitated discussion of features and helped us settle on an approach using

                  </b></p>
                <p>Cameron was born in 1980 in Brisbane, Australia. He lived
                  most of his life in Queensland and just recently (end of 2018)
                  moved to Tasmania to open a business in the beauty industry.
                  Prior to that, Cameron worked in the IT industry, having
                  worked for over a decade as an executive on a Domain Name
                  Registrar, a Drop Catcher, A PPC search engine and an
                  Affiliate Network. During this role, he picked up some
                  technical skill in mySQL and basic front-end Development,
                  however he would really like to expand this and become a real
                  technical expert. Besides work, you can find Cameron hiking,
                  camping, renovating, riding his motorbike or exercising with
                  his dogs.<br>

                <h3>Dylan</h3>
                <p>Dylan was born at Port Macquarie, Australia in 1997. He grew
                  up between New South Wales, Queensland and Papua New Guinea.
                  Most of his time was spent fishing with family or playing any
                  sport I could get my hands on but primarily Soccer and
                  Basketball. As he made his way through highschool he found
                  himself in a trainee / intern program for a local travel
                  company where he started his career working in Payroll and HR
                  helping to manage employees around Australia before finding
                  his next and more permanent position in a Project Development
                  role. He worked at DAE for five years before recently moving
                  across the country to rural South Australia where he now
                  spends his time working Administration and Systems while also
                  undertaking a degree in IT.<br>

                <h3>Kylie</h3>
                <p>Kylie was born in Hong Kong and moved to Sydney, Australia
                  with her family as a very young child.&nbsp; She grew up with
                  a variety of outdoor interests but when her Dad brought home a
                  Sinclair ZX81 (an early PC prototype made in Cambridge UK) in
                  1981 she taught herself to program in Basic. &nbsp;An interest
                  in technology was sparked.&nbsp; As a young adult, Kylie
                  worked her way through several IT roles, progressing from
                  first level Helpdesk, to LAN Admin, to Disaster Recovery for
                  Y2K prep, to Technical Process Analyst.&nbsp;Her IT interest
                  lies at the intersection of technology and people and the
                  inherent security challenges, plus what efficiencies IT can
                  offer teams.&nbsp;A move to Queensland in the late 2000s saw a
                  short career pivot to publishing and marketing.&nbsp;Returning
                  to IT work in 2015, these days Kylie typically project manages
                  teams on Programs with some sort of transformation such as
                  ERP.&nbsp;She loves bushwalking with her grown up kids.<br>
