              <p>Introduction to IT Students at RMIT</p>
            </header>
            <p>We are a team of five RMIT students who have come together to examine some
              key questions around opportunities and threats in today and the future's IT industry. We have
              completed studies of facets of the IT industry over the last few weeks and interviewed a knowledgable
              Cybersecurity expert. Together we are developing a Project Idea, to offer to the market an engaging
              and informative Orchid Identification app, Orch.I.D. This site will introduce you to us and give a
              brief outline of the features and plans for our project idea.</p>

Towards the latter end of the report we will elaborate on some detail of the features, required technologies and skillsets required for our project idea.</p>

Orch.I.D will scan the user’s photo and compare it with an expansive orchid database to deliver the closest possible match. The app will take into account key forms of the orchid, if it is monopodial or sympodial and the colours of the petals; the app will return a shortlist of likely species with corresponding  photographs and species’ details. </p>

                Affiliate Network. During this role, he picked up some technical skill in mySQL and basic front-end Development,
                however he would really like to expand this and become a real technical expert. Besides work, you can find Cameron

              <h3>Matt</h3>
              <p>Matt was born in Brisbane, Australia and moved to Melbourne, Australia a little over 1 year ago. He is
                a bit of a mixed bag in terms of his education history, having studied a little of phycology and
                accounting, he's now venturing into IT. He has always had a keen interest in things with buttons so
                naturally has felt a passion for IT since he was a child. Although Matt has no formal IT experience he
                has been involved in hardware setup, basic IT support, self-taught in some Microsoft Office Suite
                applications such as PowerAutomate and on two occasions has worked closely with developers to create new
                healthcare systems for the aged and disability sector. When he's not working or pivoting tables, he
                enjoys finding a good TV show to binge, fiercely competing with his family in a game of monopoly or
                discovering a cool new restaurant in Melbourne. <br><br>

              <h3>Kylie</h3>
              <p>Kylie was born in Hong Kong and moved to Sydney, Australia with her family as a very young child.&nbsp;
                She grew up with a variety of outdoor interests but when her Dad brought home a Sinclair ZX81 (an early
                PC prototype made in Cambridge UK)
                in 1981 she taught herself to program in Basic.
                &nbsp;An interest in technology was sparked.&nbsp;
                As a young adult, Kylie worked her way through several IT roles, progressing from first level Helpdesk,
                to LAN Admin, to Disaster Recovery for Y2K prep,
                to Technical Process Analyst.&nbsp;Her IT interest lies at the intersection of technology and
                people and the inherent security challenges, plus what efficiencies IT can offer teams.&nbsp;A move to
                Queensland in the late 2000s saw a short career pivot
                to publishing and marketing.&nbsp;Returning to IT work in 2015, these days Kylie typically project
                manages teams on
                Programs with some sort of transformation such as ERP.&nbsp;She loves bushwalking with her grown up
                kids.<br> <br>

              <h3>Dylan</h3>
              <p>Dylan was born at Port Macquarie, Australia in 1997. He grew up between New South Wales, Queensland and
                Papua New Guinea.
                Most of his time was spent fishing with family or playing any sport I could get my hands on but
                primarily Soccer and Basketball.
                As he made his way through highschool he found himself in a trainee / intern program for a local travel
                company where he started his career
                working in Payroll and HR helping to manage employees around Australia before finding his next and more
                permanent position in a Project Development
                role. He worked at DAE for five years before recently moving across the country to rural South Australia
                where he now spends his time working
                Administration and Systems while also undertaking a degree in IT.<br><br>
